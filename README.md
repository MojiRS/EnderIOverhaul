# EnderIOverhaul
Comprehensive recipe overhaul and rebalance of Ender IO

Ender IOverhaul is a set of CraftTweaker scripts and other recipe changes with the goal of polishing Ender IO's progression and rebalancing or reworking certain parts of the mod. It was designed to be able to be dropped into any sort of modpack and be as seamless an experience as possible. The overall design goals are:

* Tie Ender IO's progression more closely to vanilla's
* Rework aspects of and solidify the machine tier system
* Minimize microcrafting

So what does that mean in practice?

* The simple machine tier has been removed, as it only functioned as a speedbump for getting to the actually useful content in the mod.
* There should be less of an emphasis on quantity of core materials (such as metals) in favor of using a wider variety of ingredients, including some less conventional ones. This is a core aspect of base Ender IO, and has only been expanded upon.
* While microcrafting for microcrafting's sake has been removed as much as possible, some of the more interesting crafting mechanics are utilized more. For example, and most notably, collecting souls and using the soul binder is more widely used when making soul-tier machines.
* Select aspects of Endergy have been worked into progression where it makes sense, such as stellar alloy and the totemic capacitor. However, most Endergy content has been disabled, including the tools and armor.
* Some parts of the mod have been rebalanced and/or gated behind more advanced progression. Most notably, dark/ender tools and weapons require more advanced materials, and the enchanter is now an enhanced-tier machine. I am aware that some people will not like these changes, at least initially, but I hope you can understand that this was done to bring certain tools and machines more in line with vanilla progression and power levels.
* Chest loot tables have been customized and rebalanced to match the changes. They are completely functional, but still a work in progress. More interesting loot will hopefully be coming soon.

Please note that Ender IOverhaul is *not* some sort of expert-mode version of Ender IO. While some aspects have been rebalanced/nerfed, the goal was not the make the mod as a whole more expensive, and progression should not be grindy. It should fit in just fine with other mods in a kitchen-sink pack.

To install, simply extract the contents of the download to your modpack's instance folder - *not* to the scripts or config folder. The download does not include the required mods themselves, and you will need to install those separately.
